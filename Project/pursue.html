		    Huntsville, Alabama is built on STEM. The city of 186,000 residents
                    is home to both the Marshall Space Flight Center and the headquarters
                    for the U.S. Army Aviation and Missile Command. It's also home to
                    a new initiative aimed at introducing STEM curriculum to local
                    public elementary students. 
                    <br>
                    Judy D'Amico, who represents the STEM organization Project Lead the Way,
                    explained to a local news outlet why it's so important to reach younger schoolkids:
                    
                    <blockquote>High School in many cases is just too late... it needs
                    to come earlier, and we need to get them excited and really ready
                    to engage in STEM.</blockquote>
                    <br>
                    
                    <p class="pheader">Such is the case in Virginia, where The College of William & Mary
                    is hosting an immersive summer science camp for disadvantaged middle
                    school students who show promise in STEM subjects. Camp Launch, funded
                    by the Jack Kent Cooke Foundation, features classes on subjects such
                    as Lego Robotics and nanotechnology. It also strives to offer students
                    a glimpse into what college life would be like if they were to
                    further pursue a STEM education.</p>

		<h2>Providing inspiration</h2>
		
		<article>
		
		<p class="pheader">
			For the California-based children's publishing company Cascade Pass,
                        promoting STEM also means inspiring children who, even in their
                        imaginative early years, can harbor doubts about the breadth of
                        their opportunities. For Judith Love Cohen, who runs the company
                        with her husband David A. Katz, that includes the historical barriers
                        STEM fields have with regard to gender.
			<br>
			<br>
			Now playing the role of author and publisher, Cohen's focus is
                        on encouraging young girls to follow in her footsteps. Cascade Pass'
                        first book was titled, fittingly enough, You Can Be a Woman Engineer.
                        The company has published 28 books in all, eight of them both in
                        English and Spanish. Many of the books are written to encourage girls
                        to pursue careers in STEM and sports.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        From Camp Launch in Virginia to Cascade Pass in California, there are
                        folks across the country dedicating themselves to advancing STEM
                        education and helping groom the future professionals who will
                        shape the nation.
