                <p class="pheader">
                    
                    Born in New York City in 1906, Grace Hopper joined the U.S.
                    Navy during World War II and was assigned to program the Mark I
                    computer. She continued to work in computing after the war,
                    leading the team that created the first computer language compiler,
                    which led to the popular COBOL language. She resumed active naval
                    service at the age of 60, becoming a rear admiral before retiring in
                    1986. Hopper died in Virginia in 1992.
                    
                    
                </p>
                
                <h2>World War II</h2>
                
                <p class="pheader">
                    
                    Hopper, who became an associate professor at Vassar, continued
                    to teach until World War II compelled her to join the U.S. Naval
                    Reserve in December 1943 (she opted for the Navy, as it had been
                    her grandfather's branch of service). She was commissioned as a
                    lieutenant in June 1944. Given her mathematical background, Hopper
                    was assigned to the Bureau of Ordnance Computation Project at
                    Harvard University, where she learned to program a Mark I computer.
                    
                    
                </p>
                
                <h2>Career in Computing</h2>
                
                <p class="pheader">
                    
                    After the war, Hopper remained with the Navy as a reserve officer.
                    As a research fellow at Harvard, she worked with the Mark II and
                    Mark III computers. She was at Harvard when a moth was found to
                    have shorted out the Mark II, and is sometimes given credit for
                    the invention of the term "computer bug"-though she didn't
                    actually author the term, she did help popularize it.
                    
                </p>
                
                <p class="pheader">
                    
                    Wanting to continue to work with computers, Hopper moved into
                    private industry in 1949, first with the Eckert-Mauchly Computer
                    Corporation, then with Remington Rand, where she oversaw
                    programming for the UNIVAC computer. In 1952, her team created
                    the first compiler for computer languages (a compiler
                    renders worded instructions into code that can be read by computers).
                    This compiler was a precursor for the Common Business Oriented
                    Language, or COBOL, a widely adapted language that would be used
                    around the world. Though she did not invent COBOL, Hopper
                    encouraged its adaptation.
                    
                </p>
                
                <h2>Later Years and Legacy</h2>
                
                <p class="pheader">
                    
                    Saying that she would be "bored stiff" if she stopped working
                    entirely, Hopper took another job post-retirement and stayed
                    in the computer industry for several more years. She was awarded
                    the National Medal of Technology in 1991-becoming the first
                    female individual recipient of the honor. At the age of 85,
                    she died in Arlington, Virginia, on January 1, 1992. She was
                    laid to rest in the Arlington National Cemetery.

                    In 1997, the guided missile destroyer, USS Hopper, was
                    commissioned by the Navy in San Francisco. In 2004, the
                    University of Missouri has honored Hopper with a computer
                    museum on their campus, dubbed "Grace's Place." On display
                    are early computers and computer components to educator
                    visitors on the evolution of the technology.

                    In addition to her programming accomplishments, Hopper's
                    legacy includes encouraging young people to learn how to
                    program. The Grace Hopper Celebration of Women In Computing
                    Conference is a technical conference that encourages women
                    to become part of the world of computing, while the Association
                    for Computing Machinery offers a Grace Murray Hopper Award.
                    Additionally, on her birthday in 2013, Hopper was remembered
                    with a "Google Doodle."
                    
                </p>
                
                <p class="pheader">
                    
                    In 2016, Hopper was posthumously honored with the Presidential
                    Medal of Freedom by Barack Obama.
