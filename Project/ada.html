                    The daughter of famed poet Lord Byron, Augusta Ada Byron,
                    Countess of Lovelace-better known as "Ada Lovelace"-was born
                    in London on December 10, 1815. Ada showed her gift for
                    mathematics at an early age. She translated an article on an
                    invention by Charles Babbage, and added her own comments.
                    Because she introduced many computer concepts, Ada is
                    considered the first computer programmer. Ada died on
                    November 27, 1852.
                    
                </p>
                
                <h2>Early Years</h2>
                
                <p class="pheader">
                    
                    
                    Ada had an unusual upbringing for an aristocratic girl in the
                    mid-1800s. At her mother's insistence, tutors taught her
                    mathematics and science. Such challenging subjects were not
                    standard fare for women at the time, but her mother believed
                    that engaging in rigorous studies would prevent Lovelace from
                    developing her father's moody and unpredictable temperament.
                    Ada was also forced to lie still for extended periods of time
                    because her mother believed it would help her develop
                    self-control.
                    
                    
                </p>
                
                <p class="pheader">
                    
                    From early on, Lovelace showed a talent for numbers and language.
                    She received instruction from William Frend, a social reformer;
                    William King, the family's doctor; and Mary Somerville, a Scottish
                    astronomer and mathematician. Somerville was one of the first women
                    to be admitted into the Royal Astronomical Society.
                    
                </p>
                
                <h2>Babbage and the Analytical Engineer</h2>
                
                <p class="pheader">
                    
                    Around the age of 17, Ada met Charles Babbage, a mathematician
                    and inventor. The pair became friends, and the much older
                    Babbage served as a mentor to Ada. Through Babbage,
                    Ada began studying advanced mathematics with University
                    of London professor Augustus de Morgan.
                    
                </p>
                
                <img src="https://www.computerhope.com/cdn/analytical-engine.jpg"
                    class="imgarticle" alt="engine" width="200" height="250">
                
                <p class="pheader">
                    
                    Ada was fascinated by Babbage's ideas. Known as the father of
                    the computer, he invented the difference engine, which was
                    meant to perform mathematical calculations. Ada got a chance
                    to look at the machine before it was finished, and was
                    captivated by it. Babbage also created plans for another
                    device known as the analytical engine, designed to handle
                    more complex calculations.
                    
                </p>
                
                <p class="pheader">
                    
                    Ada was later asked to translate an article on Babbage's
                    analytical engine that had been written by Italian engineer
                    Luigi Federico Menabrea for a Swiss journal. She not only
                    translated the original French text into English, but also
                    added her own thoughts and ideas on the machine. Her notes
                    ended up being three times longer than the original article.
                    Her work was published in 1843, in an English science journal.
                    Ada used only the initials "A.A.L.," for Augusta Ada Lovelace,
                    in the publication.
                    
                </p>
                
                <p class="pheader">
                    
                    In her notes, Ada described how codes could be created for the
                    device to handle letters and symbols along with numbers.
                    She also theorized a method for the engine to repeat a series
                    of instructions, a process known as looping that computer
                    programs use today. Ada also offered up other forward-thinking
                    concepts in the article. For her work, Ada is often considered
                    to be the first computer programmer.
                    
                </p>
                
                <p class="pheader">
                    
                    Ada's article attracted little attention when she was alive.
                    In her later years, she tried to develop mathematical schemes
                    for winning at gambling. Unfortunately, her schemes failed and
                    put her in financial peril. Ada died from uterine cancer in
                    London on November 27, 1852. She was buried next to her father,
                    in the graveyard of the Church of St. Mary Magdalene in
                    Nottingham, England.
