		<h1>Women in Stem</h1>
		<article>

		<div style="line-height: 200%;">

		<p class="pheader">
			In an era when women are increasingly prominent in medicine, law, and business, 
			why are there so few women scientists and engineers? A 2010 research report by 
			AAUW presents compelling evidence that can help to explain this puzzle.
			Why So Few? Women in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) 
			presents in-depth yet accessible profiles of eight key research findings that 
			point to environmental and social barriers- including stereotypes, gender bias,
			and the climate of science and engineering departments in colleges and universities-
                        that continue to block women's progress in STEM. The report also includes 
			statistics on girls' and women's achievement and participation in these areas and 
			offers new ideas for what each of us can do to more fully open scientific and
			engineering fields to girls and women.
		</p>
		
		<h2>Stereotype Threat and Implicit Bias:<br> Barriers to Women in Stem</h2>
		
		<article>
		
		<p class="pheader">
			Stereotype threat arises in situations where a negative stereotype is relevant to
			evaluating performance. A female student taking a math test experiences an extra
			cognitive and emotional burden of worry related to the stereotype that women are not
			good at math. A reference to this stereotype, even one as subtle as taking the test in
			a room of mostly men, can adversely affect her test performance. When the burden is removed,
			however, her performance will improve. Stereotype threat is one compelling explanation for why
			women remain underrepresented in STEM fields.
			<br>
			<br>
			Many people claim they do not believe the stereotype that girls and women are not as good as boys
			and men in math and science. However, even individuals who consciously refute gender and science
			stereotypes can still hold that belief at an unconscious level. These unconscious beliefs, or
			implicit biases, may be more powerful than explicitly held beliefs and values simply because we
			are not aware of them. Even if overt gender bias is waning, as some argue, research shows that
			unconscious beliefs underlying negative stereotypes continue to influence assumptions about people and behavior.
		</p>
		<br>
		

		<h2>In STEM, A Growth Mindset Benefits Girls</h2>
		
		<article>
			
		<p class="pheader">
			Individuals with a fixed mindset are susceptible to a loss of confidence when they encounter challenges,
			because they believe that if they are truly "smart," things will come easily to them. Individuals with a
			growth mindset, on the other hand, show a far greater belief in the power of effort, and in the face of
			difficulty, their confidence actually grows because they believe they are learning and getting smarter as
			a result of challenging themselves.
			<br>
			<br>
			These research findings are important for women in STEM because encountering obstacles and challenging problems
			is in the nature of scientific work. When girls and women believe they have a fixed amount of intelligence, they
			are more likely to lose confidence and disengage from science and engineering when they inevitably encounter
			difficulties in their course work.
